# AWS ECS Worker Terraform Module for Rose Gold

Terraform module which manages [AWS ECS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecs/index.html) for the Rose Gold platform that run as workers (i.e, that do not expose HTTP/HTTPS endpoints and typically pull workloads from a queue).

## Usage

```json
module "ecs_service" {
  source = "git@github.com:cbdr/terraform-aws-ecs-worker-rg?ref=<TAG>"
  [â€¦]
}
```
